# Tech Academy - Live Project

## Introduction

During my last two weeks studying at The Tech Academy I had the opportunity to work with a group of my peers on an ASP.NET MVC application developing with C# and JavaScript. The project involved working with a local theater company developing a CMS to manage their productions, list of theater events, cast, and other content related to managing a small theater company. During the two-week sprint I had the opportunity to work on several stories targeting both the front-end and back-end, varying in the number of points assigned to them. Over the course of the sprint I was able to utilize several technologies on the back-end involved in ASP.NET MVC applications aside from C#, including Entity Framework and Razor Pages, and several technologies and frameworks on the front-end including Bootstrap and jQuery. I also had the opportunity to implement several design patterns and ASP.NET features, such as Data Transfer Objects or DTOs, Partial Views.

## Front-End Stories

### Restrict Subscriber Menu

This was my first story and was a simple change to restrict the Subscriber menu from being visible when a user had a role of "User".
